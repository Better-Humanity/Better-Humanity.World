# Contributing to Better-Humanity.world

Welcome, builders and visionaries! Better-Humanity.world is an ambitious project aiming to create a revolutionary social platform that empowers global cooperation and meaningful action.

## Where We Are Now

Right now, the project is in its **very early stages**. The GitHub repository mainly holds the project vision, documentation, and design assets — we are **looking for passionate developers, designers, and thinkers to help build the platform from the ground up**.

- Design scalable and user-friendly frontend and backend components  
- Implement advanced community, AI, and moderation systems  
- Help define technical standards and best practices  
- Collaborate closely with the community to ensure alignment with our mission

### 2. Proposing Ideas and Roadmaps  
If you have ideas or experience in building large-scale community platforms, please share your thoughts by opening issues or joining discussions on Discord.

### 3. Documentation and Design  
Even without coding, you can help by refining documentation, creating UX/UI designs, or translating content to help us reach a global audience.
