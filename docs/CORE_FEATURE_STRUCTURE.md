# Better-Humanity — Core Feature Structure (v0.2)

Better-Humanity is a social network designed to guide humanity into its next stage of evolution — a platform for meaningful connection, collective learning, and coordinated real-world collaboration.

The platform is built around seven core systems. Together, they create a digital environment where people can support one another, develop themselves, solve problems collectively, and strengthen communities across the world.

---

## 1) Identity & Profiles
Profiles express who someone is based on:
- Values
- Skills & capabilities
- Offers (what they can help with)
- Needs (where they seek support)
- Contribution history (help given, knowledge shared, problems solved)
- Reputation (based on peer endorsements, not popularity)

Profiles do **not** emphasize lifestyle performance or social comparison. Identity is based on *how you contribute* and *how you grow.*

---

## 2) Social Network Core
This is the daily communication layer.

Includes:
- Posts, comments, discussions
- Likes/appreciation indicators (gentle, non-addictive)
- Private messaging
- Group chats
- Voice and video calls

The feed is chronological, calm, and meaningful — **not engineered for addiction**.

This feels familiar like Facebook/Messenger, but **without manipulation or noise**.

---

## 3) Contribution Leveling & Reputation
Users level up by:
- Helping others
- Sharing knowledge
- Supporting community wellbeing
- Solving problems constructively

Reputation = context-based trust signals earned from people you’ve helped.

This replaces:
- Follower culture
- Popularity systems
- Prestige seeking

with:

**Earned respect, maturity, reliability.**

---

## 4) Essential Subjects (Knowledge Backbone)
A global, continuously improving knowledge system where users can:
- Explore structured topic pages
- See multiple viewpoints side-by-side
- Propose corrections, expansions, or refinements
- Grade clarity and usefulness of explanations

Think:
**Wikipedia + Reddit + peer review + beautiful UI.**

This is where humanity learns, improves, and converges on understanding.

---

## 5) Will of the People (Decision System)
A peaceful system for group decision-making.

Anyone can:
- Propose solutions to local, regional, or global issues
- Participate in structured discussion & refinement
- Vote through a **consent-based** model
  ("No strong objection → approved; objections must include alternatives")

The result shows:
- Collective intention
- Concerns
- Suggested improvements
- A realistic path forward

It does **not** enforce decisions.  
It **reveals** the shared direction of the community.

---

## 6) Global Support Center
A world map of:
- People
- Skills
- Services
- Local communities

Users can:
- Request support
- Offer help
- Get matched based on region + capability + availability

This is a **human support network**, scaling from local to global.

---

## 7) Global Donation & Regeneration Center
A transparent funding hub for:
- Ecological restoration
- Housing solutions
- Humanitarian aid
- Free energy research
- Community infrastructure

Funds are:
- Visible
- Traceable
- Community-governed

This allows **real-world transformation** to happen through collaboration.
